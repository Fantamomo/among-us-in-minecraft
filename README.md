## 🛠️ Project Status

**Actively developed — core gameplay is functional and playable.**

Some features are still incomplete or being balanced. Expect occasional bugs.

**Planned:**
- Bug fixes and stability improvements
- Gameplay balancing and polish

## 🧠 Intellectual Property

This project uses **no original Among Us assets** — no textures, sounds, models, UI elements, or source code.

All gameplay is recreated from scratch using vanilla Minecraft systems:
- Tasks use **Minecraft inventory GUIs**
- Progress is tracked via **Minecraft events**
- Visuals rely entirely on **Minecraft items and blocks**

Some task and role names are borrowed from Among Us purely for recognizability and are used descriptively only.
