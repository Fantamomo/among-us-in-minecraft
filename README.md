---

## ⚠️ Usage Warning

It is currently **NOT recommended to use this plugin**.

Reasons:

1. ❌ The plugin is **NOT finished**
2. 🧪 There is currently **only one command available**, which is used exclusively for:

    * Setting up and configuring the map
    * Creating a game **for testing purposes only**

This command exists mainly so the developer can test features during development.
Normal gameplay, balance, and stability are **not guaranteed**.

## 🧩 Tasks

* ✅ Some tasks are already implemented
* 🧊 Current tasks are mainly focused on the **Polus** map
* ➕ More tasks and maps are planned

## ⚙️ Customization

The plugin is designed to be **fully customizable**:

* 📍 Task locations can be freely configured
* 🚨 Sabotage locations can be adjusted
* 🚪 Player spawn points are configurable
* 🗺️ No map is included by default

You must **download or create your own Minecraft map** and configure all locations yourself.
Nothing is hard-coded, allowing full flexibility for custom or recreated Among Us maps.

## 🗺️ Map Setup

* All locations (tasks, sabotages, spawns, etc.) must be configured manually
* This setup-focused approach allows maximum customization and freedom

## 🚀 Planned Features
