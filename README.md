## Intellectual Property & Assets

**No original Among Us assets are used**.

This includes:

* ❌ Textures
* ❌ Sounds
* ❌ Models
* ❌ UI elements
* ❌ Source code

All visuals, mechanics, and interactions are **entirely recreated using Minecraft systems**.

## 🧠 Naming & Inspiration

Some **names and terminology** (like task names) are inspired by Among Us to:

* Clearly communicate gameplay intent
* Make tasks recognizable to players familiar with the original

⚠️ These names are **used descriptively only**.

All tasks are:

* Implemented **from scratch**
* Built entirely using Minecraft mechanics (inventories, GUIs, blocks, interactions)
* Visualized using **vanilla Minecraft items and interfaces**

Example:

* A task opens a **Minecraft inventory GUI**
* Progress is tracked via **Minecraft events**
* Visuals use **only Minecraft items and blocks**

## Project Status

**Still under active development — but playable.**

* Core systems are functional
* Some features are incomplete or unbalanced
* Expect bugs and edge cases

For full details, setup instructions, and the current state of development, see the documentation:

## Tasks & Roles

* Multiple tasks and roles are already implemented
* Some tasks are inspired by the Polus map
* All tasks are configurable and adapted for Minecraft gameplay

Future updates will include **more roles, tasks, and improvements**.

---

## Customization

The plugin is **fully customizable**:

* Task locations
* Sabotage locations
* Player spawn points

> **No map is included by default.**
> You must provide your own Minecraft map and configure everything manually.

---

## Map Setup

* Create or download a Minecraft map
* Manually configure all task, sabotage, and spawn locations

This approach provides **maximum flexibility** for creating custom or recreated maps.
Setup instructions are in the documentation:
