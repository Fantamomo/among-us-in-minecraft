# The msg-command-blocker module prevents players from sending private messages
# (/msg, /tell, /w, etc.) while they are in a game. This helps maintain fair play
# and prevents players from sharing information that could affect the outcome.
msg-command-blocker:
  # Master switch to enable or disable blocking of private message commands (/msg, /tell, /w, etc.).
  disabled: false

  # Legacy mode for command blocking:
  # - false: Attempts to automatically intercept private message commands, even when executed via /execute.
  # - true: Uses the explicit "commands" list below to determine which commands to block.
  #   Recommended if other plugins override /msg or if console errors suggest enabling legacy mode.
  legacy: false

  # List of commands to block when legacy mode is enabled.
  # These commands will be prevented while a player is in a game.
